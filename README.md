# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-With-Google-Maps
This program will accept a map file, create an adjacency list of all vertices, and out put the shortest possible route into a text file. 
This text file can be used to plot a route on google maps. 
The primary data structure used in this program is an adjacency matrix which keeps track of the edges between each of the vertices.

TO RUN: enter in on the command line the input file name, the name of your output file, and a start and end vertex.
For example: java DijkstraHighway southEastMap1.gra results.gra Atlanta Memphis@I-40/I-55 Charleston@I-26

This program requires a .gra file with specific formatting to work... I have provided a couple of example .gra files to use an inputs.

To visualize the output route, upload the output .gra file to this website.... https://courses.teresco.org/metal/hdx/
